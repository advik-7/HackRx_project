# HackRx_project
This project is focused on developing an AI-driven analytics and alarm system to analyze open court orders and pending petitions from across India, specifically in the insurance sector. The goal is to identify patterns in litigation that may indicate fraudulent activities and build a model that can trigger alerts for new cases matching these patterns.

Features
Data Ingestion: Collects and processes data from open court orders and pending petitions.
Pattern Recognition: Uses AI to identify patterns that could signal fraud in insurance-related cases.
Fraud Detection Model: Develops a machine learning model to detect potential fraud.
Alarm System: Triggers alerts for new cases that match identified fraud patterns.
Problem Statement
The insurance sector faces a growing challenge with litigation and fraud. This project aims to help insurance companies and legal entities by automating the detection of potential fraud in litigation. The system will make use of large datasets from court orders and petitions to find fraud trends and provide timely alerts.
